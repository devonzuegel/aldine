Bibliographers have pored over every scrap of early printing, trying to determine what was printed when, and how. In the absence of any documentary evidence, the only witnesses have been the books themselves. Forty-eight copies of the Gutenberg Bible still exist, complete or in part, survivors of five hundred years of upheaval and war. Most were originally purchased or donated to reforming Benedictine monasteries; those that remain are the jewels of rare book collections in libraries around the world, from Tokyo to Texas, London to New York. These books, like the men who made them, straddle a fault line between the Middle Ages and the modern world. The 15th century, like our own time, was a period of creative ferment and financial boom and bust: the business models of early printers regularly crashed and burned. Peter Schoeffer, scribe turned printer-publisher, knew this well. He and Gutenberg and Fust embarked together on production of the Mainz Psalter, a huge lectern book of liturgy considered to be the most beautiful book ever printed. But this psalm-book did not sell well. It was the individual tool for learning, introduced by his master, Johann Gutenberg with his Latin grammar of Donatus, which would sweep the world.
