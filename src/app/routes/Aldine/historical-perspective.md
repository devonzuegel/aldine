## Historical perspective ##

I've also been reading about the history and evolution of writing, and something that's striking is how much the written word has changed over time. It seems like something so static to us day to day, but new patterns and tools and styles have evolved throughout writing's entire history. For example, [spaces were only introduced](https://www.evernote.com/l/ANb3bLif9QhHCIRaqrvCaZE6iQ5uzHaBAy4) into most Western writing in the 13th century, and [a standard system of punctuation](https://www.evernote.com/l/ANavzaoLHiNBdrV9NSu76NvX-0i8qNZq07s) was only introduced into English in the 1450s with the introduction of moveable type. Of course there have been more recent changes in the way we write as well – emoji being a seemingly trivial but actually important example – but I find it particularly interesting to look back on these parts of writing that we find so "obvious" and take for granted now, because it's a great reminder that the way things work are not the way they always worked or necessarily have to moving forward.

This project's name, Aldine, comes from a man who owned a printing press around the time of Gutenberg. He realized that this new technology was not only a shift in the scale of publishing but also a window of opportunity for totally new techniques, offered writers a larger toolbox to explore and communicate ideas. (Paperbacks, etc) Aldine understood that the printing press would enable publishers to qualitatively change the work they produced.

As technology continues to evolve and shape more of our lives, I'm excited to see how publishing and the form of writing will evolve alongside it. The tools we have at our disposal are extremely powerful, and they open up new ways to consume media.

I've only touched on the tip of the iceberg here – new technology will shape far more than just the formatting of the words we read. The possibilities for collaboration, citations, explorable explanations, feedback on our work, multimedia, and more that I haven't even imagined are wide open!

It seems rather path-dependent and more of an accident than intentional design decision. After all, languages (for the most part) emerge organically through generations of semi-random evolution.
