# refund_process

### question:
I’ve returned a purchase. How does the refund process work?

### answer:
Returns are subject to the merchant’s return policy. As soon as the merchant processes your return, Affirm will record the refund. If you receive a full refund, you’ll no longer need to make payments. Any payments you’ve already made toward the loan will be reimbursed to your original form of payment—minus any interest paid.

If you receive a partial refund because, for example, you returned only part of your purchase, Affirm will apply the refund amount to your loan. If you still have an outstanding balance after the refund, you’ll need to continue making payments; if not, you’ll no longer need to make payments and we’ll reimburse you for any money you’re owed—minus any interest paid.

# what_is_merchant_processing

### question:
Why does my loan say *merchant processing*?

### answer:
Don’t worry—your loan has been approved, and the merchant is processing your order. Many merchants won’t finish processing your order until they are ready to ship your item(s). We’ll send you a message with your updated payment schedule as soon as your order has been processed by the merchant.

# change_terms

### question:
Can I change my due dates or the duration of my loan?

### answer:
You can’t change your monthly due dates or extend your loan. However, you can always make payments before they are due, and if you pay off your loan early, there’s no prepayment penalty. This may help you save on interest costs.

# ach_payment_pending

### question:
Why does my loan say *payment processing*?
