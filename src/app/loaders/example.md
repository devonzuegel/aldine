# refund_process

### question:
I've returned a purchase. How does the refund process work?

### answer:
Returns are subject to the merchant's return policy. As soon as the merchant processes your return, Affirm will record the refund. If you receive a full refund, you'll no longer need to make payments.

# ach_payment_pending

### question:
Why does my loan say *payment processing*?

### answer:
Payments made through bank transfer (ACH) can take 3â€“5 business days to process. While a payment is processing, you can't make additional payments toward the same loan. We'll let you know as soon as your payment has been processed.
